                <button class="accordion-button heading-3">Q: Does MemoryCache send my data anywhere?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>No. One of the core principles of MemoryCache is that you have full  control over the system, and that it all stays on your device. If you’re  a developer or someone who just likes to tinker with your computer applications, and you want to cloud-ify this, feel free! But we’re looking to stay entirely local. The software will form a link with folders that you point to on your computer and will utilize the contents to generate new forms of text intended to augment your existing workflows</p>

                <button class="accordion-button heading-3">Q: How does MemoryCache work?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Install the MemoryCache application on your computer. Run the program to start the locally-run server which will also load an interface in your browser to interact with your cache and personal AI agent. Create a new project and point to a folder (or multiple folders) on your computer for the AI to access. A process called ‘ingestion’ will make those files available to the AI to provide answers to queries and surface generated insights based on what you provide to the software</p>

            <div class="accordion">
                <button class="accordion-button heading-3">Q: Is this a Firefox project?</button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>No. MemoryCache is a hackathon-style project by the Mozilla Innovation  Ecosystem team, not a Firefox project. While the project uses a Firefox  extension as a way of collecting information, this is a set of scripts  and tools to augment privateGPT, a native AI application. It’s meant to  streamline the process of saving information that you might read in the  browser to store it in your own personal library of information.</p>
